"""Drive Google Flow through Playwright, attached to the user's own Chrome.

Google Flow has no public API for generation, so this attaches over CDP to a
real Chrome the user is signed into and drives the UI with genuinely trusted
input. Chrome must be started with `--remote-debugging-port` AND a non-default
`--user-data-dir`; since Chrome 136 the flag is ignored on the default profile.

Rewritten 2026-09-05. Flow moved from Next.js + tRPC on `labs.google/fx` to
Angular + batchexecute on `flow.google.com`, and authenticates by cookie rather
than by a bearer token. The old driver's API layer — `auth/session`,
`uploadImage`, `media.getMediaUrlRedirect` — is gone, and could not be repaired
by editing URLs: there is no token left to call `aisandbox-pa` with. So every
step is now UI-driven. Measured against the live app, not guessed:

* the prompt box is a `div[contenteditable]`, not a `<textarea>` — the only
  `<textarea>` on the page is `g-recaptcha-response`, which is what the old
  driver had been typing into;
* the whole settings popover is `[role=radio]` elements with no `aria-label`,
  so they are matched on a line of their own `innerText` ("videocam\nVideo");
* "upload" opens the OS file dialog and has no `<input type=file>` in the DOM,
  so it has to be caught with `expect_file_chooser`;
* a finished clip is a `flow-video-tile` in the grid, newest first, and that
  tile is the only reliable handle on it. The first version of this file
  identified clips by the `<video>` src instead, because the probe clip did
  mount a player on its own — and then the first real shot finished with its
  tile on screen, no player mounted, and the wait sat through all 810 seconds
  of its timeout for a clip that was already there. The player's src is not
  merely inconvenient but wrong: it changes host once a clip settles
  (`flow.google.com/asb/<token>`, not `flow-content.google/video/<id>`).

Getting the finished clip onto disk is the fiddliest part and the comments on
`download_clip`, `_submenu_point` and `_catch_download` are the record of why
each step is shaped the way it is. The short version: the tile's own "Tải
xuống" → "720p Kích thước gốc", opened by hovering *across* the parent row,
found by `elementFromPoint` because those rows have no box, clicked from script
because a real click on them does nothing, and collected from a download
directory this driver names because `expect_download` never fires on a
CDP-attached browser.

The settings are always written and then read back off the pill. The tab was
found sitting on `x2` and `crop_16_9`: inheriting that would silently double
the credit cost of every clip and deliver landscape for a 9:16 series.
