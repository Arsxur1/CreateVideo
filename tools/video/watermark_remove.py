"""Remove a provider watermark from generated clips.

Subscription video providers stamp a small static mark on every clip — Flow puts
a sparkle in the lower third, others use a corner logo. Cropping it away is what
most pipelines end up doing by hand, and it costs frame: cropping the bottom 12%
of a 9:16 clip and re-squaring the aspect throws away ~20% of the picture.

`delogo` keeps the frame and interpolates the patch from its own edges, which on
a small mark over a soft background is invisible. Crop stays available for when
the mark sits over detail that interpolates badly.

Measured on Ngày 8, and the split is sharper than "badly" suggests. Over the dark
soil of the underground shot, delogo was undetectable. Over a cream tablecloth
printed with fine speckle it was *worse than the watermark it removed*: edge
interpolation produces smooth horizontal streaks, and a smooth streak inside
high-frequency texture is far more visible than the semi-transparent mark was.
Shrinking the box from the padded preset to the detected 48px, and again to 40px,
only reduced the streak — it did not hide it.

Crop was then ruled out as well — it re-frames every shot — which forced the
question of what the mark actually *is*. It is not painted on, it is composited:
the same sparkle measures +42 above its background on bright cloth and +77 on
dark soil, which is what an alpha blend does and an opaque stamp does not. So it
can be inverted rather than covered. Fitting one global colour with a per-pixel
alpha over 32 samples spanning backgrounds from 20 to 213 gives C=225 and a peak
alpha of 0.45, and `observed = (1-a)*background + a*C` solved for background
returns the original texture instead of a guess at it.

That is the `unblend` method, and it is the default now. Its one failure is the
dark end: below a background of about 90 the detail was already crushed by 8-bit
encoding before the mark landed, so dividing by (1-a) amplifies quantisation
into a dark star with a bright rim. Refitting in linear light made that worse.
Under 90, fall back to delogo — which is invisible on soil anyway. Mixing those
two costs nothing, because unlike crop they both keep the full frame.

Ngày 8 split six clips to unblend and two to delogo, chosen by measuring the
brightness of the ring around the mark.

A note for whoever reads a `detect` result on already-cropped clips: it will
still report `looks_like_watermark: True`. The test is "brighter than its
surroundings, in the same place, in every clip", and a sunrise through a window
in a locked series satisfies that. On Ngày 8 the second hit was the sun and a
dew-drop highlight. Confirm a detection by looking at the region before acting
on it.

Finding the box is the part worth automating, and the obvious signals both fail.
Per-pixel variance inside one clip finds nothing, because a locked-off shot is
mostly static too. Looking for pixels identical across clips fails as well: a
semi-transparent mark takes the colour of whatever is under it, so on the real
Flow output that region varied *more* than the average pixel.

What does hold is that the mark is brighter than its immediate surroundings, in
the same place, in every clip. So subtract a local mean from each frame and take
the per-pixel minimum across clips: only a spot that every clip lifts above its
own background stays positive. Scattered pixels survive that too, so the box is
the densest cluster of the surviving score, not its bounding box.
